	<p>Hi my name is Phuong Dang, or you can call me Kenny. I am from Frankfort Kentucky, and I graduated from 
	Western Hills High School. I decided to study Electrical Engineering because I want to help the community in 
	the most substantial way possible. I believe that this way is to contribute to making technologies more energy 
	efficient. On a side note, my hobbies include playing basketball and guitar. 
	I currently work at the ECE department front desk. </p>
